# Retrosheet-MySQL
## Purpose

The purpose of this Gitub repository is to take in or request any enhancements to the Retrosheet database.  Feel free to submit any SQL scripts to create views, add tables, etc and I will use them as I see fit. 

If there are any enhancements that you would like to see to the database (i.e. new views, new indexes to improve query performance) then make an issue and I will try and make those improvements.

## Other Resources

All the database documentation and tutorials on how to use the database are located on the wiki: ADD LINK.  

Post any questions you have on StackOverflow.com with the tag 'Retrosheet-MySQL', which I monitor on an ongoing basis.
